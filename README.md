# Random-song-generator
This program generates a random song suggestion based on the genre selected by the user.

# Background
As I continued learning Python and getting more comfortable with it, I looked for every opportunity I could get to write a Python program. 

In my day-to-day life, I looked at the parts of my routine that repeated every weekday: waking up for work, having my morning coffee, catching up on the news, commuting to and from work, working out, making dinner, and setting my alarm to wake up for work the following day.

Thanks to my Google assistant, my home routine was relatively efficient and, believe it or not, fun (not an ad ;) ). As I woke up every morning, Google would play my favorite podcasts, update me on the news, tell me about the weather, and even wish me a great day - the perfect morning! One feature I particularly enjoyed was being able to select any song from Spotify to play as my morning alarm. The problem, however, was that by the end of the day I was so tired that having to get creative to choose a song for my alarm seemed almost daunting. That’s how the idea for this project was born.

# Project Description
I started by putting together a list of my favorite music genres that my “go-to morning jams” typically fall under. My initial thinking was that I would then connect to the Spotify API and use its music library for my program to pick songs from selected playlists and generate the suggestions for my morning alarm. Unfortunately, I ran into some issues that I struggled to solve, so I decided to try another way.

Instead, I found number of websites with the top songs in my selected categories and scraped them for the song and artist names. I then plugged those into my script and matched them to the corresponding music genres. As a result, I had a program that was completely personalized to me and helped me easily pick a song for my morning alarm that I was very likely to enjoy.

# Project Takeaways
Although my solution for the problem I set out to solve was different to my original idea, I was very proud of being able to build something that I could use in my day-to-day life that added real value and was completely personalized.

I’m a true believer that when it comes to coding, one learns the best through real-world practice. This particular project helped me learn how to read and understand html code, how to use new packages I haven’t used before (e.g. BeautifulSoup), and showed me that there is always room for growth and improvement. Therefore, I continue working on side projects, as, I believe, this is the best way to grow and stay up to date with new tools and methodologies.
